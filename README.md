## usage
put the source code in the data folder and revise the path in the corresponding file.

You can test and debug MIPS code  in the `Mars for Compile 2022.jar`

## lexical analysis
`lexer.py`
- Use ply.lex to generate lexical analysis code
- you can modify the regular expression for extra features

## syntax analysis
`parser.py`

`parser.out` and `parsertab.py` is automatically generated
- Use ply.yacc and the corresponding grammar file to generate syntax analysis code
- The method is LALR(1), automatically generated by ply.yacc
- The output is an AST
grammars used is in the powerpoint

## semantic analysis and IRcode generation
`Quad.py`
- since the progress of semantic analysis and IRcode generation are similar, we finish them in one file
- The main idea is to use the AST genearted by the parser to check if there is any semantic error and generate IRcode at the same time
